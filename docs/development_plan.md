# Development Plan: Meme Generator App

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for building an Expo-based mobile application for social media meme generation. The app will leverage OpenAI's image generation API (using the gpt-image-1 model) and structured output capabilities for chat functionality.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **State Management**: Context API with Hooks
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API (gpt-image-1 model for image generation)
- **Structured Output**: OpenAI structured output API for chat feature
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local storage, option to integrate with Firebase for cloud storage
- **UI Components**: React Native Paper or Expo UI components

## Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **Authentication System** (optional) - User accounts for saving and sharing memes
- **Meme Generator Engine** - Integration with OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model
- **Template Library** - Predefined meme templates and categories
- **Text & Styling Tools** - Text overlay, filters, and customization options
- **Social Sharing** - Export to social media platforms
- **Chat Feature** - AI-assisted chat using OpenAI structured output API

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Week 1)
- Initialize Expo project
- Set up project structure
- Implement basic navigation
- Create core UI components
- Set up OpenAI API integration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
- Implement meme template selection screen
- Develop meme generation functionality using OpenAI gpt-image-1
- Create text and style customization tools
- Build basic image editing capabilities

### Phase 3: AI Chat & Enhancement (Week 3)
- Implement AI chat feature using OpenAI structured output
- Add meme suggestion capabilities
- Integrate social sharing functionality
- Implement local storage for meme history

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Week 4)
- Optimize API usage and image processing
- Improve UI/UX based on testing
- Add animations and transitions
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 5)
- Comprehensive testing across devices
- Bug fixes and refinements
- App store preparation
- Documentation finalization

## Technical Considerations

### OpenAI API Integration
- We will use the OpenAI gpt-image-1 model specifically for image generation
- API calls will be optimized to minimize token usage through careful prompt design
- Implement caching strategies to reduce repeated API calls (store previously generated memes locally)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages and fallback mechanisms
- Rate limiting management to prevent quota overruns
- Secure API key storage using environment variables

### Structured Output for Chat
- Implement JSON schema for structured conversation flows in the meme suggestion feature
- Use the structured output API to create consistent, usable chat interactions
- Develop conversation patterns specific to meme creation and enhancement
- Create schemas for different meme styles, formats, and generation options
- Design system prompts that guide the AI to deliver creative and appropriate meme suggestions

### User Experience & Accessibility
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Ensure text readability on generated memes
- Support accessibility through appropriate contrast ratios and text sizing
- Provide haptic feedback for interactions where appropriate
- Design intuitive, gesture-based image manipulation controls

### Performance Optimization
- Implement progressive image loading
- Optimize image resizing and processing on-device before upload
- Minimize network requests through strategic caching
- Implement debouncing for user input to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider background processing for image generation to keep UI responsive

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for templates and generated images
- Optimize image processing for mobile devices
- Consider offline capabilities with cached templates

## User Experience Focus
- Simple, intuitive interface for meme creation
- Quick generation process with minimal steps
- Easy sharing to social platforms
- Helpful AI chat assistant that understands meme culture and trends

## Future Enhancements
- User accounts and cloud synchronization
- Community features for sharing and discovering memes
- Advanced editing tools (layers, masks, effects)
- Custom template creation
- Analytics for popular meme trends
